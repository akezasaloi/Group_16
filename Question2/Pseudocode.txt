Creating a routing system that manages network congestion and ensures redundancy for fault tolerance 

Input:
-Data packets

1.Declare a variable called network packet header that holds the packet's destination
2.Create and initialise a counter(router) starting from zero
3.Create an array ( routing table) that contains destinations of all network packets
4.Create an empty array (routed network packets) that holds the routed network packets.
5.Loop through the routing table and check if the network packet's destinations is its among destinations.
6.When it finds it it adds the network packet with it's destination in the routednetwork packets array 
7.Delete the assigned destination from the routing table to avoid congestion, redudancy and latency
8.Display the routed network array.

Output:
-An array containing routed data packets.
