Creating a routing system that manages network congestion and ensures redundancy for fault tolerance 

Input:
-Data packets

1.Create network packet header that holds the packet's destination
3.Create a list called routing table with destinations of all network packets
4.Create a list (routed network packets) that will contain the routed network packets.
5.If a network packet's destinations matches a destination in the routing table then write it in the routed network packets list 
7.Delete that destination from the routing table to avoid congestion, redudancy and 
8.Otherwise match item with the second item in the list of packet's destination and repeat step 5
9.Display the routed network packets list.

Output:
-An list of routed network packets.
